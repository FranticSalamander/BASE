# CISA M365 Security Configuration Baseline for Exchange Online

Microsoft 365 (M365) Exchange Online is a cloud-based messaging platform that gives users easy access to their email and supports organizational meetings, contacts, and calendars. This Secure Configuration Baseline (SCB) provides specific policies to strengthen Exchange Online security.

Many admin controls for Exchange Online are found in the **Exchange admin center**.
However, several of the security features for Exchange Online are shared between Microsoft
products and are configured in either the **Microsoft 365 Defender portal**
or **Microsoft Purview compliance portal**. Generally
speaking, the use of Microsoft Defender is not strictly required for
this baseline. When noted, alternative products may be used in lieu of
Defender, on the condition that they fulfill these required baseline
settings.

The Secure Cloud Business Applications (BASE) project run by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) provides guidance and capabilities to secure federal civilian executive branch (FCEB) agencies' cloud business application environments and protect federal information that is created, accessed, shared, and stored in those environments.

The CISA BASE SCBs for M365 help secure federal information assets stored within M365 cloud business application environments through consistent, effective, and manageable security configurations. CISA created baselines tailored to the federal government's threats and risk tolerance with the knowledge that every organization has different threat models and risk tolerance. Non-governmental organizations may also find value in applying these baselines to reduce risks.
